# Introduction to Robotics

This repository contains all my homework and final project while studying DCS361: Introduction to Robotics taught by Hui Cheng (成慧) at Sun Yat-sen University.

All the homework is finished with Webots R2021a under Ubuntu 20.04.3, I didn't test them in other operating systems, but it should also work just fine if you've install all the dependencies and set the environment variables correctly.

Contents:

- hw2: Build a car with Mecanum wheels.
- hw3: Simple line following car (two different line types: circle and ellipse).
- hw4: Implement PRM planning algorithm, let the car move from the starting point to destination automatically.
- hw5: Implement RRT planning algorithm, let the car move from the starting point to destination automatically.

- Final Project: Given three different maze, design a real-time perception, path planning and control system, let the car move from the starting point to destination automatically.
